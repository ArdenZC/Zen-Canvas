# Supported platforms

## Product targets

Zen Canvas supports:

- Windows, with the existing source-handle and verified-directory mutation
  authority;
- macOS 13 or later on Apple Silicon (`aarch64-apple-darwin`), with the
  recoverable namespace and provider-coordination strategies described in
  `MACOS_MUTATION_THREAT_MODEL.md`.

Intel Macs, Universal binaries, Rosetta, and Linux are not product targets.

## macOS operation support

macOS runtime capability is intentionally fine-grained. Copy, duplicate,
rename, same-volume move, replacement, Safe Trash, restore, package-root
mutation, iCloud coordination and permanent-delete strategies exist in the
backend. Cross-volume, external-volume, network-volume and generic File
Provider operations remain runtime/fixture dependent; they are not a blanket
platform guarantee. Individual operations fail closed with a stable
capability, materialization, identity or coordination error. Secure physical
SSD erasure is not available.

The backend chooses the strategy; the renderer does not infer it from a path.
Operation Preview shows the chosen strategy and conflict policy, and the
backend resolves it again after confirmation. Read-only volumes, offline or
ambiguous providers, permission failures, identity races, and target collisions
are runtime refusals, not platform-wide feature deferrals.

Symlinks are operated on as link objects and are never followed. A hardlink
directory entry can be moved or renamed; permanent deletion removes only that
entry and does not claim to erase all links. Package roots move as whole logical
objects. Package-internal mutation is rejected.

## Recovery and cleanup

macOS Safe Trash is Zen Canvas's durable recoverable namespace, recorded by the
existing cleanup ledger and restored through History. Replacement retains the
old target in a private backup and restores both source and destination only
after identity verification. Permanent delete first uses a private quarantine;
failed verification or deletion retains that object for manual review. No
operation bypasses Operation Preview, journals, Safe Trash, or restore
revalidation.

## Cloud and provider behavior

iCloud content is not implicitly downloaded during indexing, Preview, or
mutation. Preview marks non-local content as an explicit materialization
precondition; the current backend does not silently start that download. A
user-confirmed download reports progress, supports cancellation, then
revalidates the original preview before retry. Generic File Provider paths use
`~/Library/CloudStorage` only as a routing hint. Under ADR-0003 Decision B,
ordinary metadata operations use `NSFileCoordinator` with the provider's
user-visible URL and filesystem physical identity; the public item/domain
translation and provider-manager download APIs are not treated as authority
for arbitrary third-party extensions. Byte operations require explicit
user-consented coordinated content access and a bounded open/read proof;
`BoundaryReadable` is not full materialization, so the byte operation still
reopens and consumes the source once. Provider-internal IDs, path text and
POSIX metadata are not interchangeable. Real iCloud, generic File Provider,
external APFS, exFAT and network-volume fixtures are **NOT VERIFIED — fixture unavailable**
when absent; the CI fixture tests print
`NOT VERIFIED — REAL FIXTURE NOT PROVIDED` and do not convert a skip into a
pass claim.

Portable source retirement uses an exclusive APFS claim or the Zen-owned
mode-0700 `.zen-canvas-retirement/<random-session>/` namespace after a
runtime capability probe. The Darwin `linkat` plus pathname `unlinkat` fallback
is not used because a rebinding race could delete an unexpected object. A
verified target-first copy may therefore preserve both source and target as
`mac_source_retirement_pending`; the existing journal records the unique
retirement slot and recovery retries only after revalidating the source
identity. Unknown/read-only volumes and network mounts without
disconnect/reconnect durability evidence return
`mac_filesystem_capability_insufficient` as a retirement-capability result;
when a target-first copy has already been verified, the source remains
preserved and the journal records `mac_source_retirement_pending` instead of
attempting source cleanup.

## Windows and Linux

Windows behavior remains unchanged: its source-handle and verified-directory
primitives remain the filesystem authority. The legacy system Recycle Bin path
continues to fail closed where source binding cannot be proven; Safe Trash is
the durable cleanup route.

Linux is not a supported product platform. It is outside product support,
build, release, and mutation-safety scope.
The fact that shared Rust code can be parsed on Linux is not a support or
security guarantee.

## Verification boundary

The supported-platform gate is Windows Quality, macOS Apple Silicon Quality,
and Dependency Audit. A macOS feature is not reported as release-verified from
Windows cross-compilation: native Apple Silicon compile/test, provider and
external-volume fixtures, race stress, and packaging evidence must come from
the remote macOS workflow at the exact pushed commit.

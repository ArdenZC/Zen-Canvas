# Zen Canvas — Master Development Plan

Status: canonical long-horizon development plan

Purpose: preserve the product, architecture and sequencing conclusions produced by the File Library 2.0 / Preview Platform research and keep later implementation Tracks aligned with those conclusions.

This document is intentionally more stable than `ROADMAP.md`, initiative files and Codex taskbooks. It defines the long-horizon product direction, architectural invariants, Wave boundaries and stop/escalate rules. Current progress belongs in `STATUS.md` / `ROADMAP.md`; implementation authorization belongs in the active initiative; detailed execution belongs in per-Track taskbooks.

The external-project evidence and the original Round 1–4 synthesis behind this plan are preserved under [`research/file-library-preview/`](research/file-library-preview/). Those notes explain **why** the program reached these conclusions; this Master Plan remains the higher-level long-horizon direction.

## 1. Product north star

Zen Canvas is a calm, local-first, safety-oriented **file lifecycle / file-governance workspace**.

Its job is to help users:

- find and understand files quickly;
- work with a managed File Library when they want semantic organization and durable knowledge;
- browse ordinary filesystem locations without forcing them to abandon Finder/Explorer habits;
- preview content quickly and safely;
- organize, deduplicate, clean up and recover files with explicit user control;
- preserve platform-native expectations on macOS and Windows.

Zen Canvas is **not** intended to become:

- a Finder/Explorer replacement that forces a new filesystem interaction model;
- a cloud drive;
- a general document editor or media suite;
- a universal OCR toolbox;
- an autonomous Agent shell;
- a generic MCP/tool execution host;
- a RAG/vector-database product;
- a second operating-system search engine;
- a feature bundle that hides platform limitations behind false parity.

The product should add value around the user's existing filesystem rather than demand that users migrate all habits into Zen.

## 2. File Library 2.0 product model

File Library 2.0 is one product surface with two first-class working modes that share the same higher-level workspace shell.

### 2.1 Library Mode

Library Mode is the managed/semantic view.

It is backed by existing managed authorities such as File Library Query V2 and managed selection. It is appropriate for:

- managed files;
- semantic/query-driven organization;
- saved views and filters;
- durable metadata and classification;
- higher-level workflows that rely on indexed/managed truth.

### 2.2 Browse Mode

Browse Mode is the familiar filesystem view.

It exists because many users want Finder/Explorer-like direct navigation and should not be forced to adopt a semantic Library workflow for ordinary file browsing.

Browse Mode is:

- filesystem/path oriented at the UX level;
- session-scoped and ephemeral at the authority level;
- progressive and cancellable;
- able to work on unmanaged locations;
- deliberately separate from durable managed-library/query truth.

Browse Mode must not silently create scan roots, index unmanaged trees, or turn ephemeral path/session state into durable database authority.

### 2.3 Shared dimensions

Library vs Browse is independent from presentation dimensions such as:

- List vs Grid;
- Inspector / Context Panel state;
- Preview state;
- per-target presentation preferences.

Do not build separate duplicated products for every combination. Share the workspace shell while keeping underlying authorities separate.

### 2.4 Platform fidelity

macOS users should encounter Finder-like concepts where appropriate; Windows users should encounter Explorer-like concepts where appropriate.

The product should feel native to each platform without pretending the platforms are identical. Platform capability, permission, provider, volume and native-preview differences must remain explicit.

Intel macOS is outside the current supported macOS target; Apple Silicon is the supported macOS architecture for this plan.

## 3. Core architecture invariants

These invariants are binding across Waves unless changed by an explicit architecture/governance decision.

### 3.1 Identity is not path

`FileIdentity` / backend source identity is not the same thing as `PhysicalPath`.

Paths are resolution/routing inputs. Durable identity, cache identity, operation identity and publication authority must not be inferred from a pathname when a stronger backend-verified identity exists.

Rename/move should preserve higher-level identity when the verified physical/content identity survives the operation.

### 3.2 Managed and ephemeral authorities stay distinct

Managed Library data and Ephemeral Browse data may project into common UI contracts, but their authority/lifecycle remains different.

Do not persist session-scoped Browse refs, cursors, path refs, handles or temporary provider tokens as durable truth.

### 3.3 Availability is not deletion

Offline, unavailable, disconnected, provider-remote, downloading, permission-blocked, stale and unknown states must not be interpreted as file deletion.

Managed truth is reconciled by its existing watcher/reconciliation authorities.

### 3.4 Watchers are hints, reconciliation is truth

Filesystem/provider notifications are change hints. They may invalidate cached/enumerated results and schedule bounded refresh, but must not be treated as perfectly ordered row-level truth.

Overflow or ambiguity fails toward bounded reconciliation/refresh, not fabricated completeness.

### 3.5 Progressive work by default

Large locations and large result sets must not require full enumeration before useful UI appears.

Prefer:

- progressive pages;
- bounded batches;
- cancellable requests;
- stale-publication rejection;
- visible/foreground work before speculative/offscreen enrichment.

### 3.6 Shell-first responsiveness

Interactive shell/navigation must not wait for:

- network/provider probes;
- external-volume checks;
- indexing/reconciliation;
- thumbnail generation;
- Preview restoration;
- deep folder analysis;
- Git/project enrichment.

### 3.7 Global resource budgets

Expensive work participates in `WorkScheduler` resource admission/backpressure.

No subsystem may silently create an unbounded executor or pretend to hold one resource lease while actually using unrestricted CPU/IO/native-helper concurrency.

Foreground has priority; lower-priority work still needs bounded fairness and must not starve forever.

### 3.8 Explicit materialization; no implicit hydration

Cloud/File Provider content must not be downloaded merely because Zen wants a thumbnail, Preview, hash, analysis result or deeper metadata.

Materialization/content availability is entry/source scoped, not a Location-wide truth.

Metadata-only operations should stay metadata-only when possible.

All byte-dependent consumers use the existing authoritative content-read/materialization boundary and revalidate at the actual open boundary.

### 3.9 Safety authorities are preserved

Existing authorities remain authoritative unless an explicit initiative changes them:

- File Library Query V2;
- `LibrarySelectionV1`;
- Global Index;
- managed scan-root/watcher/reconciliation truth;
- content/platform byte-read eligibility and safe open/revalidation;
- filesystem physical-identity validation;
- Operation Preview / journal / Safe Trash / cleanup / Restore;
- Rule / Analysis / Content authorities already defined by the project.

A feature Track must adapt to these authorities rather than quietly replace them.

## 4. Preview Platform north star

Preview is a platform, not a single modal component.

### 4.1 Core model

Preview is built from separable concerns:

- Preview command/context;
- `PreviewSession` lifecycle;
- source resolution + `sourceVersion`;
- authoritative content-read/materialization access;
- provider registry;
- preview representation;
- host rendering/lifecycle.

The shell/session exists before slow source/provider work so cancellation, timeout and shell-first behavior are always available.

### 4.2 Providers vs hosts

A Preview Provider understands a content/source type.

A Preview Host renders/owns the lifecycle in a specific environment.

Examples of future hosts include:

- Zen floating Preview;
- Zen pinned Preview;
- macOS native Quick Look integration;
- Windows Quick Preview/native integration.

Do not conflate provider logic with native host integration.

### 4.3 Read-only and safe by default

Preview must remain read-only and fail closed.

Default rules:

- no arbitrary code execution;
- no macro execution;
- no implicit network/remote-resource loading;
- sanitize HTML/Markdown output;
- no implicit AI/content-understanding side effects;
- archives are indexed, not silently extracted;
- folder analysis is bounded/progressive;
- generic renderer/provider code does not receive renderer-authorized arbitrary raw paths.

### 4.4 Native capability strategy

Use strong native platform capability where it provides safe, high-quality preview/thumbnail coverage, but keep native integration behind platform adapters and lifecycle boundaries.

Existing macOS Quick Look thumbnail capability is an asset to adapt, not something to rewrite for architectural symmetry.

Windows should receive equally deliberate adaptation, not macOS assumptions translated by filename/path checks.

## 5. Thumbnail infrastructure principles

Thumbnail is shared infrastructure for List, Grid, Inspector, Preview placeholders and Folder Preview.

It is not a UI-specific image-loading hack.

Binding principles:

- small / medium / large semantic variants;
- platform-scale mapping in one place;
- bounded/deduplicated/cancellable work;
- viewport/interactive work receives appropriate priority;
- byte-reading generation uses the authoritative Read Gate;
- no implicit provider hydration;
- cache identity uses stable backend-verified identity + source version + variant + renderer/version when durable reuse is allowed;
- path is not persistent logical cache identity;
- ephemeral/session-only sources use bounded session/memory caching rather than guessed cross-session identity;
- existing `MacThumbnailService` is preserved/adapted rather than replaced.

## 6. Long-horizon Wave plan

### W-1 — Research / reference discovery

Goal: understand existing platform behavior and comparable open-source/native approaches before architecture is frozen.

The detailed reference-project matrix and Round 1–4 reasoning are preserved in [`research/file-library-preview/README.md`](research/file-library-preview/README.md).

Key conclusions carried forward:

- users value instant Space/Quick-Look-style preview because it preserves browsing flow;
- Finder/Explorer familiarity is an asset, not something Zen should intentionally erase;
- strong implementations separate filesystem enumeration, preview generation, caching, cancellation and native platform behavior rather than building one monolithic view;
- local-first and native-first approaches are preferable for the core browsing/preview experience;
- reference projects are inputs, not authorities — Zen keeps its own safety, identity and lifecycle contracts.

W-1 research is complete for the current File Library/Preview program. New research may be added when a later Wave reaches a genuinely new platform boundary.

### W0 — Specification / architecture freeze

Goal: convert research into reviewed product and architecture contracts before production implementation.

W0 freezes:

- Library/Browse IA;
- identity/location/session contracts;
- Preview architecture;
- WorkScheduler/Thumbnail/change infrastructure boundaries;
- materialization/read semantics;
- performance/QA expectations;
- W1 dependency and merge plan.

W0 does not authorize feature implementation.

### W1 — Foundation

Goal: build the shared contracts and infrastructure required before the user-facing File Library 2.0/Preview experiences.

Tracks:

- W1-00 governance/initiative activation;
- W1-01 Contract Spine;
- W1-02 Workspace Navigation / WorkspaceSession;
- W1-03 Ephemeral Browse Core;
- W1-04 Location Core;
- W1-05 WorkScheduler;
- W1-06 Preview Contract Core;
- W1-07 Materialization / Read Gate;
- W1-08 Thumbnail Infrastructure;
- W1-09 Ephemeral Change / Refresh;
- W1-10 Integration Surface;
- W1-11 Performance / QA;
- W1-12 closeout.

W1 exit gate: Foundation behavior, cancellation, stale-publication protection, resource cleanup, read/materialization safety, cross-platform compile/fixture evidence and performance baselines are proven. W1 does **not** ship the full new File Library UX.

### W2 — File Library 2.0 Experience

Goal: build the user-facing File Library workspace on top of W1 rather than smuggling UI/product decisions into infrastructure Tracks.

Planned scope:

- shared Library/Browse workspace shell;
- familiar platform-adaptive navigation;
- mode switching without forcing one mental model;
- List / Grid presentation;
- Context Panel / Inspector;
- per-target presentation preferences;
- managed Library search/filter and bounded Browse current-folder search/filter;
- selection/focus/navigation behavior shared with Preview.

Explicit restraint:

- unmanaged recursive whole-location/global filesystem search is not implicitly authorized;
- Query V2 is not replaced by a new Query V3 just to simplify UI implementation.

### W3 — Preview Platform

Goal: turn the W1 Preview Core into the user-facing Zen Quick Preview experience.

Planned scope:

- Space/toggle Quick Preview command behavior;
- floating and pinned Preview hosts;
- metadata fallback;
- rich built-in providers such as Text/Code, Markdown, JSON/YAML/XML, CSV/TSV, Folder, ZIP and Image;
- bounded sibling navigation;
- rapid-switch/cancellation/cleanup behavior;
- corrupt/unsupported/provider-failure fallback;
- large-folder Preview performance gates.

PDF/Office/iWork/audio/video and similar strong native formats should prefer safe native capabilities where appropriate rather than automatically receiving a duplicate Zen renderer.

W3 does not itself authorize Finder/Explorer system extension integration.

### W4 — Native Integration

Goal: integrate the stable Preview/File Library foundations with native platform surfaces where that integration provides real user value.

Planned macOS scope:

- Apple Silicon native Quick Look extension/host integration where appropriate;
- native lifecycle/provider/file-provider correctness;
- real fixture and signing/packaging validation.

Planned Windows scope:

- Zen Quick Preview integration aligned with Windows conventions;
- evaluate Preview Handler/Explorer integration separately rather than assuming macOS APIs/UX map 1:1;
- DPI/display/shell lifecycle/native failure QA.

Native integration remains an adapter/host problem; it must not create a second content-read, mutation or identity authority.

### W5 — Release / hardening gate

Goal: stabilize and polish the complete supported product rather than add another feature wave.

Focus:

- performance and resource steady state;
- long-session stability;
- cancellation/leak/handle audits;
- cross-platform behavior and fixtures;
- accessibility and keyboard behavior;
- security/materialization/provider hardening;
- packaging/signing/update behavior;
- visual and interaction polish;
- technical-debt deletion only where replacement/equivalence is proven.

No major feature expansion belongs in W5.

## 7. Gate and dependency rules

Wave numbering is meaningful. A later Wave must not be implemented inside an earlier Track simply because the code location is convenient.

Current critical dependency examples:

- W1 Contract Spine precedes parallel Foundation Tracks;
- Thumbnail byte-reading work requires W1 Read Gate;
- W1 Integration Surface follows the underlying Foundation contracts;
- W1 Performance/QA follows integration;
- W2 does not start until W1/F4 closes;
- W4 native integration does not start until the core Preview platform is stable enough to host it safely.

When a dependency is unavailable, stop or build only the explicitly allowed contract/fake seam. Do not bypass the dependency.

## 8. Cross-platform policy

Zen supports Windows and macOS as first-class product platforms, while preserving truthful platform differences.

Rules:

- avoid generic `isMac ? yes : assume Windows same` behavior;
- capability checks are layered: build/platform implementation, runtime environment, source/provider state and operation/read eligibility;
- unsupported native capability must be reported as unsupported, not emulated unsafely;
- network/external/provider/cloud behavior fails closed where identity/readability cannot be established safely;
- platform UX may differ when native expectations differ, while core concepts remain coherent.

## 9. Performance and scale expectations

The File Library/Preview program is designed for large real libraries, not demo-sized folders.

Preserve existing Query V2 100k/1M gates.

Foundation/experience work must be designed around:

- 100k-entry Browse progressive behavior;
- bounded first-page work;
- no full-list React render assumptions;
- cancellation on target/session switch;
- stale page/cursor/result rejection;
- bounded thumbnail generation and caches;
- scheduler interference checks with real heavy authorities;
- resource/handle/temp-file steady state;
- unavailable/offline locations without false deletion;
- platform release-build measurements before hard absolute RSS/FD ceilings are frozen.

## 10. UX principles carried from research

### 10.1 Familiarity without stagnation

Users who like Finder/Explorer should be able to browse in a familiar way. Zen should improve the workflow around that model rather than force semantic Library behavior everywhere.

### 10.2 Complexity is earned

Do not expose implementation telemetry, provider internals, architecture metadata or low-value controls in the main interface merely because the backend knows them.

Prefer progressive disclosure and a calm default surface.

### 10.3 Quick actions must preserve flow

Space/Quick Preview, navigation, open/reveal and lightweight context actions should feel immediate and non-destructive. The Preview shell appears before expensive content work and remains independently cancellable.

### 10.4 Failure is a product state

Offline, materialization-required, unsupported, stale, corrupt, permission-denied and provider-failed states receive explicit UI behavior. They are not collapsed into generic errors or hidden retries that perform surprising work.

## 11. Explicitly deferred / not authorized by this plan

Unless a new reviewed initiative changes the plan, do not silently pull in:

- OCR as a general product module;
- RAG/vector database;
- AI Preview / automatic content understanding;
- generic Agent runtime;
- shell/MCP/tool execution;
- third-party Preview plugin SDK;
- arbitrary unmanaged recursive/global filesystem search;
- Query V3;
- managed watcher rewrite;
- second content-read/materialization engine;
- second filesystem mutation/recovery system;
- automatic cloud hydration;
- Intel macOS support;
- Linux support;
- new schema merely to make a local Track easier to implement.

These ideas may be evaluated in future initiatives, but they are not part of the current File Library 2.0 / Preview development authorization.

## 12. Development governance

### 12.1 Document hierarchy

When documents differ, use this hierarchy:

1. security/correctness constraints already enforced by authoritative production systems;
2. this Master Development Plan for long-horizon product/architecture direction;
3. current reviewed specification set;
4. current active initiative for implementation authorization;
5. ROADMAP / STATUS for current sequencing and truth;
6. per-Track Codex taskbook for execution detail.

A lower-level document cannot silently expand the scope of a higher-level document.

### 12.2 Codex / agent rule

Every new implementation Track must require agents to read this document before coding.

Agents must not broaden scope because a related implementation is convenient. If implementation appears to require:

- a schema change;
- a new durable authority;
- a cross-Wave feature;
- a safety-authority rewrite;
- a performance-threshold reduction;
- platform support that the current Wave does not authorize;

stop and escalate to architecture/initiative review.

### 12.3 PR discipline

Prefer short-lived, bounded PRs with explicit authority and DoD.

Do not create a multi-week mega branch that mixes Foundation, UI, Preview providers and native integration.

Independent architecture/code review is required before merging significant Tracks even when CI is green.

### 12.4 Test-artifact hygiene

Follow `AGENTS.md` / `DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md`:

- task-owned test fixtures/staging/cache should live on the worktree/repository drive where practical;
- Windows tasks must not default large task-owned temp data to system `C:` when the worktree is elsewhere;
- task closeout removes owned temporary artifacts and reports exact residual paths if cleanup cannot complete;
- shared dependency/build caches are not deleted merely to claim cleanup.

## 13. Change control for this plan

This document is deliberately stable.

Update it only when the long-horizon product/architecture plan genuinely changes, not when a Track merely finishes or a PR number changes.

Changes that alter Wave boundaries, product positioning, core authority, platform strategy or explicit non-goals should use a dedicated architecture/governance PR with rationale.

Routine progress updates belong in `STATUS.md` / `ROADMAP.md` / initiative closeout, not here.

## 14. Current canonical supporting documents

- `docs/project/research/file-library-preview/` — external-project research evidence and Round 1–4 synthesis behind the File Library/Preview program.
- `docs/project/ROADMAP.md` — current sequencing/progress.
- `docs/project/STATUS.md` — current repository truth.
- `docs/project/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md` — execution and closeout workflow.
- `docs/project/initiatives/W1-file-library-foundation.md` — current W1 implementation authority.
- `docs/project/specs/file-library-preview/00-MASTER-SPEC.md` — W0 master specification.
- `docs/project/specs/file-library-preview/01-PRODUCT-IA.md` — File Library product/IA contract.
- `docs/project/specs/file-library-preview/02-CORE-DOMAIN-CONTRACTS.md` — identity/domain contracts.
- `docs/project/specs/file-library-preview/03-PREVIEW-ARCHITECTURE.md` — Preview architecture.
- `docs/project/specs/file-library-preview/04-INFRASTRUCTURE-CONTRACTS.md` — scheduler/thumbnail/watcher/read infrastructure.
- `docs/project/specs/file-library-preview/05-PERFORMANCE-QA.md` — QA/performance contract.
- `docs/project/specs/file-library-preview/06-W1-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` — W1 dependency/Track plan.

This Master Plan explains **why the whole program is shaped this way**. The research evidence preserves **how those conclusions were derived**; the supporting specifications define **what the currently frozen contracts mean**; initiatives/tasks define **what is authorized to change now**.

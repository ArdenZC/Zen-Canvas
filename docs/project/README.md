# Zen Canvas Project Operating System

`docs/project/` is the current-truth and long-horizon planning layer for Zen Canvas. It answers what the product is, which architecture is authoritative, what is active now, what is planned next, and how work is allowed to move from idea to production.

This directory does not replace production code, security contracts, historical taskbooks, or closeout evidence. It provides the stable index that tells contributors which of those sources are current and how they relate.

## Read order

For any non-trivial change, read in this order:

1. [`MASTER_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`](MASTER_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md) — long-horizon product direction, architecture invariants, Wave boundaries and explicit stop/escalate rules. This is deliberately more stable than the current Roadmap or a single initiative.
2. `docs/project/STATUS.md` — current baseline, current initiative, validation and release state.
3. `docs/project/PRODUCT_MAP.md` — user-facing product domains and their boundaries.
4. `docs/project/ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md` — durable authorities, projections, platform boundaries and compatibility bridges.
5. The active initiative record under `docs/project/initiatives/`; start new records from [`initiatives/TEMPLATE.md`](initiatives/TEMPLATE.md).
6. `docs/project/ROADMAP.md` — authorized sequencing and current/next Waves.
7. `docs/project/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md` — branch, review, CI and closeout rules.
8. Domain-specific specifications, security, remediation, design and QA contracts named by the active initiative.
9. The current bounded execution task under `docs/project/tasks/` when work is delegated to Codex/another agent.

For rationale/history rather than current authorization, use `docs/project/research/`. In particular, [`research/file-library-preview/`](research/file-library-preview/) preserves the external-project research and Round 1–4 synthesis behind the File Library 2.0 / Preview Platform architecture.

`AGENTS.md` is the stable repository entry point. It must point here instead of embedding a changing project stage or baseline.

A lower-level initiative, taskbook or PR may narrow this plan but must not silently expand or contradict the Master Development Plan. If implementation appears to require a cross-Wave feature, new durable authority, schema change or safety-boundary rewrite, stop and escalate through architecture/governance review.

## Source-of-truth precedence

Separate normative safety authority from descriptive implementation truth. Normative authority defines what the product is allowed to do; implementation truth describes what the repository currently does.

### Normative authority — what is allowed

The following define the permitted safety and privacy boundary:

- security and privacy contracts;
- filesystem mutation safety, recovery and restore contracts;
- command and window permission boundaries;
- supported-platform safety contracts;
- accepted durable safety invariants.

These contracts remain authoritative even if current code violates them. A safety bug in production code must not be used to weaken a normative constraint.

### Descriptive implementation truth — what exists now

The following describe the current implementation and must be read as evidence of behavior, not permission to violate normative authority:

- current production code;
- executable tests;
- the actual database schema.

If normative safety authority and descriptive implementation truth disagree, treat the mismatch as an implementation defect or governance conflict. Do not use the current code to override the safety constraint; stop, report the conflict and fix or explicitly resolve it before proceeding.

### Project and historical context

After the two authority categories above, use this order for project context:

1. `docs/project/MASTER_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` for long-horizon product/architecture direction and Wave boundaries.
2. `docs/project/STATUS.md` for current project state, active initiative, current implementation baseline and release state.
3. The explicitly active initiative specification, accepted ADRs and narrower domain contracts.
4. `docs/project/ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md` and `docs/project/PRODUCT_MAP.md`.
5. `docs/project/research/` for preserved research evidence/rationale that explains how reviewed architecture decisions were derived.
6. Historical `docs/remediation/`, `docs/design/`, QA closeouts, archived prompts and old PR records.

Historical/research documents remain evidence. They do not become current execution authority merely because they contain a newer-looking date, branch name or implementation checklist.

## Project-state vocabulary

Use these terms precisely:

- **Implemented** — code or documentation exists on the stated commit.
- **Validated** — the stated checks passed on the exact stated commit.
- **Packaged** — an installer/package build succeeded on the stated commit.
- **Released** — a user-facing release/tag was actually published.

Do not describe validated or packaged work as released.

## Document ownership

- `MASTER_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` changes only when the long-horizon product/architecture direction, Wave boundaries, platform strategy or explicit non-goals genuinely change. It is not a progress log.
- `STATUS.md` changes whenever the active initiative, baseline, validation state, schema, package version or release state changes.
- `PRODUCT_MAP.md` changes when product ownership or workspace boundaries change.
- `ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md` changes when durable authority, runtime ownership, persistence, platform ownership or compatibility boundaries change.
- `ROADMAP.md` changes when sequencing or authorization changes.
- `TECH_DEBT.md` tracks debt with explicit exit conditions rather than vague cleanup intentions.
- `RISK_REGISTER.md` tracks currently open project-level risks; historical remediation risk registers remain domain evidence.
- `DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md` changes only when the engineering process itself changes.
- `DECISIONS/` stores accepted cross-cutting architecture/governance decisions.
- `initiatives/` stores bounded current and planned initiatives. Completed initiatives remain as concise records, not as the current status source.
- `tasks/` stores bounded execution instructions and cannot silently expand higher-level authorization.
- `research/` stores evidence/rationale from external projects, platform investigations and design research. Research can explain a decision but cannot authorize implementation by itself.

## Rule against duplicate current truth

Do not create another file whose purpose is “current project status”, “active phase”, “current baseline” or “what to do next”. Update `STATUS.md` or `ROADMAP.md` instead.

`MASTER_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` is intentionally not another current-status file: it records the stable long-horizon conclusions and constraints that explain why the current Roadmap/initiatives are shaped as they are.

Domain documents may describe their own state, but must not silently override the project-level state recorded here.

# Zen Canvas Project Status

Last verified: 2026-10-08

## Current execution truth

- **PM-02B — COMPLETE / MERGED / OWNER REVIEW PASSED / MERGE-AFTER MASTER CI SUCCESS.** PR #317 squash-merged as `master@fc433f305aafbc2326a15a39eb93476ebd4da20d` / tree `f7ce37786816b1af31a43f70e351430067790f6d`; merge-after master CI [37265536740](https://github.com/ArdenZC/Zen-Canvas/actions/runs/37265536740) is **SUCCESS**. Accepted production candidate remains `823edc2b87c958f4bfdf7f6ba4211328140ccca2` / tree `63918653f3791386cb86f7208b01deda96ea7f89`, Schema 37, package 0.1.40. Owner accepted the core Windows native evidence; pending-at-exit recovery and real suspend/resume remain accepted UNVERIFIED limitations. Watcher and resident-lifecycle historical native failures are remediated and Owner-requalified PASS. See the [PM-02B result](tasks/AI-ONLY-PM-02B-EVENT-SCHEDULE-TRIGGER-RESULT.md) and [Windows native record](tasks/evidence/PM-02B/windows-native-qualification.md). PM-03 was subsequently activated through PR #320; current implementation status is below.
- Historical PM-02B event-delivery checkpoint for Draft PR #317: the post-root-authority Windows failure at source `4777e87e6ec86e629538a806df55a7ea7bf34e1f` was localized to `RecommendedWatcher` extended-length paths missing watcher-root routing. The narrow normalizer fix is source commit `fc5e2b7be00eb29db7629a21e3c640fe1626cf34` / tree `39b229033e26d42feec48dcd3c3ce7874e1cea8a`. Its first exact-head hosted CI [36990307913](https://github.com/ArdenZC/Zen-Canvas/actions/runs/36990307913) remains a failure: the new Windows real-watcher regression timed out at durable revisions `0/0/0`; no trace was available on that run. The CI-only follow-up is `68ddd8d7bf08aa11cecc3ecc07d3bdeb3c480a71` / tree `c4951a967f64022c2fc299005edbb1712689bad4`; fresh exact-head hosted CI [36991861097](https://github.com/ArdenZC/Zen-Canvas/actions/runs/36991861097) is **SUCCESS**. Its real Windows `RecommendedWatcher` regression passed **1/1** with a root-scoped trace of Create/Modify callback→queue→payload→single-root route→durable watcher/library revision 1→2 and applied-revision catch-up; the full Windows Rust suite passed **1,119 / 1,119** with 24 ignored. This is backend regression evidence only. At that historical checkpoint, Windows Owner requalification was not run; subsequent c823 qualification exposed the resident-lifecycle blocker recorded above. That checkpoint recorded PM-02B as **OWNER REVIEW PENDING** and PR #317 as open; it is superseded by the current final disposition above. PM-03 was not active then and was authorized separately through PR #320.
- PM-02A activation baseline is `master@b698228e94a1857e0610cccb2364e1027f6b1b0d` from merged PR #312. PM-02A implementation PR #313 is **COMPLETE / MERGED / OWNER REVIEW PASSED** at `master@195e3b18b4bfa718276829f9ed35414714689a7f`; merge-after master CI [36821813846](https://github.com/ArdenZC/Zen-Canvas/actions/runs/36821813846) is **SUCCESS**. Schema 36 was the PM-02A merged baseline. PM-02B is now **COMPLETE / MERGED / OWNER REVIEW PASSED** through PR #317 at `master@fc433f305aafbc2326a15a39eb93476ebd4da20d`; merge-after CI [37265536740](https://github.com/ArdenZC/Zen-Canvas/actions/runs/37265536740) is **SUCCESS**, and the merged production schema is **37**. The historical event-root and resident-lifecycle failures, fixture repair, remediation and Owner requalification remain preserved in the PM-02B result/evidence records. PM-03 subsequently completed and merged through PR #322.
- **Windows Global Index Recovery #323 — COMPLETE / MERGED / CLOSED with scoped Owner acceptance and explicit evidence exceptions.** PR #327 squash-merged as `master@1619e335468c432da5a5b3a6e246e1ea1c7db32c` / tree `70c1e97eb68a01506a796140277af640a5e0fe60`; merge-after master CI [37722150775](https://github.com/ArdenZC/Zen-Canvas/actions/runs/37722150775) is **SUCCESS**. The historical native report remains INCOMPLETE: the Phase-A pre-Quit PID is waived/UNVERIFIED and the seeded transient `rebuild_required` was not directly captured. Independent observed defects remain OPEN as [#328](https://github.com/ArdenZC/Zen-Canvas/issues/328) and [#329](https://github.com/ArdenZC/Zen-Canvas/issues/329); neither is claimed fixed by #323.
- **AI-only Product Migration (#273) — COMPLETE / CLOSED.** PM-01, PM-02A, PM-02B and PM-03 are COMPLETE / MERGED / Owner Review PASS. PM-03 merge-after master CI [37561509211](https://github.com/ArdenZC/Zen-Canvas/actions/runs/37561509211) and post-merge reconciliation CI [37563539120](https://github.com/ArdenZC/Zen-Canvas/actions/runs/37563539120) are SUCCESS. Issue #273 is CLOSED / completed. Independent issue #323 was not part of that migration and is now CLOSED / completed through PR #327 with scoped Owner acceptance.
- PM-01 is **COMPLETE / MERGED — OWNER REVIEW PASSED — MERGE-AFTER MASTER CI SUCCESS**. The final product/evidence disposition is recorded in the PM-01 Result; schema remains 35.
- Release truth remains separate and unchanged: W6-10A / RC1 is frozen; W6-10B remains **BLOCKED** on valid SmartScreen/UAC evidence; W6-10C remains **DEFERRED / UNVERIFIED** without a supported Apple Silicon host; full supported-platform release PASS is **NOT CLAIMED**; publication remains **DEFERRED**.
- Accepted production functional baseline inside PR #242: `88fc663392371049fda2d71b85bd4815d073bfe0`; tree `5ca511f055b02bb511bc0873ffc5c2a2d26efadf`.
- Evidence/docs successor before the Solid / Calm freeze: `057a74af5838108354651df84b7184f81ac94ad0`; tree `69e4649185b0cfd936bd986b6c0b0f5fd85ac1f5`.
- Functional / authority disposition: **ACCEPTED**. First-entry Browse, admitted ephemeral-session truth, Preview Core/Read Gate, PDF range/lazy/continuous rendering, Markdown, image transport, provider ordering, pinned-source semantics, Details and cancellation behavior are frozen against presentation-only migration.
- Windows native functional evidence: **CAPTURED / ACCEPTED** at production source `88fc6633...` through the legal native Folder Picker -> existing `openBrowse()` route.
- Visual authority amendment (2026-09-21): **Solid / Calm Demo V2 is the current material/presentation canonical**. V26 remains authority for structure, navigation hierarchy, information architecture and unsuperseded interaction contracts. **Liquid Glass material direction is revoked**.
- The `88fc6633...` Windows screenshots remain valid functional/native regression evidence but are **HISTORICAL for final visual parity** because the visual authority changed afterward.
- Production-head hosted CI: [35608830144](https://github.com/ArdenZC/Zen-Canvas/actions/runs/35608830144) — **SUCCESS**. Evidence/docs-head CI: [35611907483](https://github.com/ArdenZC/Zen-Canvas/actions/runs/35611907483) — **SUCCESS**.
- Solid / Calm presentation migration is **IMPLEMENTED / MERGED through PR #242**; accepted presentation production source `8fd246476e025636d4606a44d23688865ab89cc2` / tree `475a8d0e0295abbe37b3afa115738fa3602785e7` has hosted CI [35685110417](https://github.com/ArdenZC/Zen-Canvas/actions/runs/35685110417) — **SUCCESS**. Owner Windows exact-head native product and Solid / Calm visual acceptance are **PASS**; W6-09 is **COMPLETE / CLOSED / MERGED**.
- Full supported-platform native PASS is **NOT CLAIMED**. Windows DPI/scaling, Forced Colors, real macOS GUI/Retina, release-path/release-binary acceptance, accessibility qualification and remaining lifecycle/mutation residuals are explicitly accepted for W6-10; see the [W6-09 closeout result](tasks/W6-09-WHOLE-PRODUCT-NATIVE-REGRESSION-CLOSEOUT-RESULT.md).

## Current visual authority

- Freeze manifest: [Solid / Calm Demo V2 Freeze Manifest](../design/w6-09/SOLID-CALM-V2-FREEZE-MANIFEST.md).
- Current task record: [W6-09 Solid / Calm V2 Presentation Migration](tasks/W6-09-SOLID-CALM-V2-PRESENTATION-MIGRATION-ACTIVATION.md).
- Final closeout result: [W6-09 Whole-Product Native Regression — Closeout Result](tasks/W6-09-WHOLE-PRODUCT-NATIVE-REGRESSION-CLOSEOUT-RESULT.md).
- Presentation migration must preserve the accepted functional baseline; it is not authorization to reopen backend/Preview/Browse architecture.

## Current initiative

**Post-#323 Historical Audit Residual & Technical Debt Reconciliation — Owner Gate**

Status: **ACTIVE — SPECIFICATION ONLY / OWNER GOVERNANCE; NO PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTATION AUTHORIZED.**

Authority: [initiative](initiatives/post-323-audit-residual-technical-debt-reconciliation.md), [issue #330](https://github.com/ArdenZC/Zen-Canvas/issues/330) and [Owner matrix](tasks/POST-323-AUDIT-RESIDUAL-TECH-DEBT-RECONCILIATION-RESULT.md). Baseline is `master@1619e335468c432da5a5b3a6e246e1ea1c7db32c` / tree `70c1e97eb68a01506a796140277af640a5e0fe60`; merge-after CI 37722150775 SUCCESS.

This gate reconciles open product defects #328/#329, retained W6 residuals, current TECH_DEBT exit conditions, #270/#283, release-only evidence gaps and current documentation drift before the Post-AI-only Product / Architecture Rebaseline. It does not authorize an omnibus refactor, new Files features, AI Eligibility implementation, System One/Preference production, or release publication.

Workflow ownership is now binding: Owner/ChatGPT owns architecture and GitHub governance; Codex Cloud is the only development environment; Windows local is frozen-candidate native acceptance only.

### Completed Windows Global Index Recovery #323

Status: **COMPLETE / MERGED / CLOSED — SCOPED WINDOWS NATIVE RECOVERY OWNER ACCEPTED WITH EVIDENCE EXCEPTIONS; MERGE-AFTER MASTER CI SUCCESS.**

PR #327 squash-merged as `master@1619e335468c432da5a5b3a6e246e1ea1c7db32c` / tree `70c1e97eb68a01506a796140277af640a5e0fe60`; merge-after master CI [37722150775](https://github.com/ArdenZC/Zen-Canvas/actions/runs/37722150775) is **SUCCESS**. Issue #323 is CLOSED / completed. The original native qualification remains historically INCOMPLETE and its explicit evidence exceptions are preserved. Issues #328 and #329 remain independent OPEN defects.

## Completed AI-only Product Migration

**AI-only Product Migration**

Status: **COMPLETE / CLOSED — PM-01, PM-02A, PM-02B and PM-03 COMPLETE / MERGED / OWNER REVIEW PASSED; issue #273 CLOSED / completed. ZDB-03 research checkpoint remains PAUSED at INCONCLUSIVE_LOW_DELTA.**

Authority: [AI-only Product Migration](initiatives/ai-only-product-migration.md). Issue: [#273](https://github.com/ArdenZC/Zen-Canvas/issues/273), CLOSED / completed. PM-03 PR #322 and post-merge reconciliation PR #324 are merged with merge-after CI success.

Result: [PM-01 Core Experience Result](tasks/AI-ONLY-PM-01-CORE-EXPERIENCE-RESULT.md). Final reviewed PR head `3d91c6689bb62d10eddf343419f00c4abaea9fee` passed CI [36439052294](https://github.com/ArdenZC/Zen-Canvas/actions/runs/36439052294); PR #287 squash-merged as `master@ee3347dbc9963067851378da2acd0fd0d85d114c`; merge-after master CI [36447256280](https://github.com/ArdenZC/Zen-Canvas/actions/runs/36447256280) is **SUCCESS**. Owner Review passed after direct diff, CI, manifest and 12-screenshot evidence inspection.

PM-01 established the production migration from optional/fallback semantics to AI-required new Organize/Cleanup semantics while preserving deterministic safety authorities.

Immediate implementation boundaries:

- new/refreshed Organize semantics require current Managed AI; no legacy Rules/classification semantic fallback;
- new Cleanup executable findings require current conservative AI assessment evidence, while existing deterministic findings/history remain inspectable/recoverable;
- consume backend readiness from #279/#285; frontend readiness remains presentation;
- correct active semantic explanation, Cleanup trace operation, onboarding and Rules/Preference product copy;
- preserve Operation Preview, confirmation, Safe Trash, journal and Restore authority;
- PM-02A adds manual Intent-to-Plan orchestration; PM-02B adds review-only schedule/event preparation under Owner review. PM-03 was not part of those earlier activations and is now complete/merged; System One/Laya/Jev production runtime and Preference Memory persistence remain inactive.

Research issue #283 remains separate/non-blocking from production. ZDB-01 is COMPLETE/FROZEN; ZDB-02 baseline/remediation is COMPLETE/ACCEPTED; ZDB-03B is COMPLETE/MERGED and frozen at `INCONCLUSIVE_LOW_DELTA`; the Owner research disposition pauses >=300 comparative execution. PM-02A is COMPLETE / MERGED through PR #313 with Owner Review PASS and merge-after CI SUCCESS. PM-02B is **COMPLETE / MERGED** through PR #317 with Owner Review PASS and merge-after master CI [37265536740](https://github.com/ArdenZC/Zen-Canvas/actions/runs/37265536740) SUCCESS; its watcher extended-path and resident-lifecycle native failures are historical, remediated and Owner-requalified PASS. PM-03 is **COMPLETE / MERGED** through PR #322 with merge-after master CI 37561509211 SUCCESS; the separate research gate remains non-blocking. #270 remains separate. Release publication remains deferred.

ZDB-03A has a [deterministic offline resolver and 60-case conformance fixture](../../research/zen-decision-bench/results/ZDB-03A-OFFLINE-PREFERENCE-PROTOTYPE-RESULT.md). PR #300 is **MERGED** as `master@b92fe40a18b38b60febe5618caf72ba3e988bcdb`; merge-after CI 36564738415 is **SUCCESS**. ZDB-03A is **COMPLETE / MERGED / OWNER REVIEW PASSED — CONFORMANCE ONLY**. Its 60-case JSONL must never become ZDB-03B signal/effectiveness evidence.

ZDB-03B is defined as a separate [120-case synthetic Preference signal screen](tasks/ZDB-03B-PREFERENCE-SIGNAL-SCREEN-ACTIVATION.md). **OWNER REVIEW PASSED** for the definition. Merge of PR #301 activates only **ZDB-03B1 Profile + Target construction**. The initial B1-only activation has been superseded by the Owner-frozen B1 inputs and bounded B2A authorization below; later adjudication, corpus assembly, provider execution and comparison remain separately gated. The >=300 comparative-corpus superiority gate remains separate and inactive. ZDB-04+ remain NOT ACTIVE.

ZDB-03B1 has a [12-profile pack and 120-target pack](../../research/zen-decision-bench/results/ZDB-03B1-PROFILE-TARGET-CONSTRUCTION-RESULT.md). **OWNER RE-REVIEW PASSED** at `020b2270464a2c6b7cf98c886d3f5293e2e41b65`; both pack hashes are **FROZEN FOR ZDB-03B2 INPUT**. Merge of PR #302 activates only ZDB-03B2 deterministic assignment + History Pool + separate Owner Adjudication construction. Same-case Generative baseline/provider execution (B3) and Preference comparison (B4) remain NOT ACTIVE.

## ZDB-03 Owner research disposition

[Owner research disposition](tasks/ZDB-03-OWNER-RESEARCH-DISPOSITION.md): **RESEARCH CHECKPOINT COMPLETE — PAUSED / NO FURTHER COMPARATIVE EXECUTION AUTHORIZED**.

ZDB-03B is complete and frozen at `INCONCLUSIVE_LOW_DELTA`: 7 Preference-caused changes, 6 beneficial / 0 harmful / 1 other, raw net +6, with all hard gates passing. The result is not upgraded to a directional-signal claim because the pre-registered minimum of 10 changed decisions was not reached. The frozen screen exposed only 10 actionable supported/correction-backed Preference recommendations; three were superseded by higher current authority, leaving seven Preference-caused final changes. Gate A therefore remains inconclusive, and Gate D has no observed conflicting-case denominator.

The **>=300 Stage-B comparative corpus remains NOT ACTIVE**. No threshold, History, finite-choice, corpus, baseline, resolver or evaluator tuning is authorized to increase exposure. Any future Preference study requires a new separately pre-registered Owner activation.

Research issue #283 is non-blocking for the product track. PM-02A is **COMPLETE / MERGED** through PR #313 with Owner Review PASS and merge-after CI SUCCESS. PM-02B is **COMPLETE / MERGED** through PR #317 at `master@fc433f305aafbc2326a15a39eb93476ebd4da20d`; Owner Review passed and merge-after master CI 37265536740 is **SUCCESS**. PM-03 is **COMPLETE / MERGED** through PR #322 at `master@4848e51dc9cfd1b87b6f4281aac7717452840cd8`; merge-after master CI 37561509211 is SUCCESS. PM-02 remains bounded to Automation Intent / Trigger / Policy architecture and may not introduce Preference Memory production authority, System One/Laya/Jev runtime integration, hidden personalization or autonomous mutation authority.

## PM-02A Automation Intent Foundation activation

[PM-02A activation taskbook](tasks/AI-ONLY-PM-02A-AUTOMATION-INTENT-FOUNDATION-ACTIVATION.md): **PM-02A COMPLETE / MERGED through PR #313 — OWNER REVIEW PASSED — MERGE-AFTER MASTER CI SUCCESS**.

PM-02A is intentionally narrower than full Automation:

- durable `AutomationIntentV1` and `AutomationRunV1`;
- `workflow=organize_plan` only;
- `trigger=manual` only;
- review required / auto-execute false;
- durable File Query V2 scope semantics resolved to a fresh backend snapshot per run;
- existing Organization Plan + Managed AI analysis authorities are reused;
- a manual Automation Run stops after creating/enqueuing a reviewable Organization Plan and recording the plan reference.

PM-02A explicitly does **not** authorize scheduled/watcher Automation Intent execution, autonomous file mutation, Cleanup automation, a second AI queue/scheduler, general agent/tool/shell execution, Preference Memory production, System One, Laya/Jev, RAG/vector storage, PM-02B or PM-03.

Existing Rule Repository V2 remains intact as advanced Policy/Signal compatibility authority. Existing watcher-driven Rule evaluation remains Rule behavior and must not be relabeled as an Automation Intent trigger.

Owner activation review passed and PR #312 merged. PR #313 is **COMPLETE / MERGED** at `master@195e3b18b4bfa718276829f9ed35414714689a7f`. The [Windows native qualification record](tasks/evidence/PM-02A/windows-native-qualification.md) records **Windows native + restart acceptance PASS / OWNER ACCEPTED**. Final evidence head `fb00c4e1029e54743902efc7c2f6765641cc593e` completed GitHub Actions run `36816026415`; attempt 1 had one unrelated macOS PDF CMap timeout and Owner-authorized attempt 2 succeeded on the same exact HEAD with no source/test change. Final documentation-closeout PR head `701a22d7c31ea336b34b1e110d893e590f32cecd` passed CI `36820155950`; merge-after master CI `36821813846` is **SUCCESS**.


## PM-02B Event / Schedule Trigger activation

[PM-02B activation taskbook](tasks/AI-ONLY-PM-02B-EVENT-SCHEDULE-TRIGGER-ACTIVATION.md): **OWNER REVIEW PASSED — MERGE ACTIVATES PM-02B IMPLEMENTATION ONLY**.

Frozen first-slice direction:

- configured triggers: Manual, Schedule, Managed scope changed;
- Manual Run now remains available for every enabled Intent;
- automatic triggers may only prepare reviewable Organization Plans;
- fixed review-required / never-auto-execute policy remains unchanged;
- scheduled recurrence is bounded calendar time (timezone + minute + weekdays), not arbitrary cron;
- managed-scope-change reuses existing watcher/scanner truth and a monotonic root change clock; no second watcher;
- one process-local, non-polling Trigger Coordinator may wait for the nearest deadline and explicit wake hints;
- automatic orchestration must use existing WorkScheduler / RuntimeResourceGovernor as Background work;
- startup/wake are recovery/catch-up opportunities, not a user-selectable startup trigger;
- automatic Runs suppress duplicate plan creation while an earlier Plan still requires review;
- PM-03, Cleanup automation, autonomous mutation, Preference Memory production, System One and Laya/Jev remain gated.

Activation PR #316 is merged at the exact implementation base 91589a89974324e821b4963b062c3070949252a8. PM-02B implementation PR #317 is **COMPLETE / MERGED** as `master@fc433f305aafbc2326a15a39eb93476ebd4da20d` / tree `f7ce37786816b1af31a43f70e351430067790f6d`; merge-after master CI 37265536740 is **SUCCESS**. Owner review of final production candidate 823edc2b87c958f4bfdf7f6ba4211328140ccca2 / tree 63918653f3791386cb86f7208b01deda96ea7f89 is PASSED. Exact-candidate CI 37016643626 and lifecycle-remediation CI 37013892661 are SUCCESS. Pending-at-exit recovery and real suspend/resume remain accepted UNVERIFIED evidence limitations, not product failures. See [PM-02B result](tasks/AI-ONLY-PM-02B-EVENT-SCHEDULE-TRIGGER-RESULT.md) and [Schema 37 contract](SCHEMA_37_AUTOMATION_TRIGGERS.md). The PM-02B stage was followed by separate PM-03 activation PR #320.

## Residuals and next gates

- W6-05 native evidence remains the historical degraded baseline; it must not be upgraded to PASS by W6-07 presentation work.
- Historical Organization Plan exact-head native authoritative-preview evidence remains owner/native verification required unless new evidence closes it.
- Cleanup Windows extended-path rejection: **CLOSED / FIXED**; W6-09 performs regression coverage only unless a supported-native reproduction reopens it.
- Typed/folder Quick Preview residual: **ACCEPTED DEFER**. W6-08 repository/browser evidence closes the known presentation/support gap; Windows exact-head native Quick Preview visual acceptance is **PASS**. Real macOS GUI verification is explicitly carried to W6-10 release qualification. Browser PASS != Native PASS.
- Organization Plan authoritative safe-preview degradation: **ENVIRONMENT-SPECIFIC**; supported-native fixture reproduction remains required and must stay fail-closed.
- Global Index unavailable / zero-source state: **ACCEPTED DEFER**; exact-head native source/state truth remains to be re-evaluated.
- Browse first-scan / recovery friction: **ACCEPTED DEFER**; exact-head native first-launch/restart recovery remains to be re-evaluated.
- W6-09 status: **COMPLETE / CLOSED — OWNER WINDOWS NATIVE PRODUCT ACCEPTANCE PASS; SOLID / CALM WINDOWS VISUAL ACCEPTANCE PASS; FULL SUPPORTED-PLATFORM NATIVE PASS NOT CLAIMED**. Production source `8fd246476e025636d4606a44d23688865ab89cc2` / tree `475a8d0e0295abbe37b3afa115738fa3602785e7` has fresh hosted CI [35685110417](https://github.com/ArdenZC/Zen-Canvas/actions/runs/35685110417) — **SUCCESS**. The accepted production baseline `88fc663392371049fda2d71b85bd4815d073bfe0` (tree `5ca511f055b02bb511bc0873ffc5c2a2d26efadf`) and its functional/native evidence remain unchanged. The exact Windows visual evidence is retained externally at `F:\CargoTarget\w6-09-solid-calm-owner-review-00787888\windows\` with package `F:\CargoTarget\w6-09-solid-calm-owner-review-00787888.zip`.
- Final closeout authority: [W6-09 Whole-Product Native Regression — Closeout Result](tasks/W6-09-WHOLE-PRODUCT-NATIVE-REGRESSION-CLOSEOUT-RESULT.md). Evidence package SHA-256 is `43236C3E82ACF409261436E598EBE191EA048715CCCB2832C84795C705F0BEF8`. W6-10A is **COMPLETE / CLOSED / MERGED**. W6-10B historical RC1 qualification is **FAIL / BLOCKED**, while R1 diagnosis proves **RC1 clean-profile startup PASS**. Owner has retained RC1 for a separate clean-profile requalification and has not authorized RC2. W6-10C remains **ELIGIBLE / NOT ACTIVE**; publication remains deferred.

## W6-07 closeout record

- Scope: cross-surface presentation/state-grammar consolidation across the
  existing shell, Files, Settings, Organize, Cleanup, History/Restore,
  Automation, Overview and Vault projections; no durable authority, schema,
  filesystem-safety, provider, native-permission or release-state change.
- Production candidate exact head: `d20b80d493688c19117361a84f9ab2ca4e092093`;
  tree: `6613c991ed924730cbb63a895f84fad748a31ffc`.
- Validation: exact V26 freeze verification PASS; local typecheck, full frontend
  test suite, remediation, performance-architecture check and frontend build
  PASS on the candidate head.
- Browser evidence: default and 980×680 browser rendering reached Overview,

- Native/platform evidence: **PARTIAL** — 15 required Windows native visual
  captures were obtained from the exact docs-only successor `a758bc13`; the
  required Windows Forced Colors state remains `UNVERIFIED`, and macOS native
  evidence remains `UNVERIFIED`. W6-05 remains the accepted native baseline
  for broader product acceptance and W6-09 owns coherent whole-product native
  regression. The exact-head capture record is in
  [`outputs/w6-07-phase7-native-review/README.md`](../../outputs/w6-07-phase7-native-review/README.md).
- Owner review, hosted CI and merge: **COMPLETE / MERGED through PR #238**.

## W6-08 execution record

- Activation baseline: `master@60d43db7de7f9ac598d0262a237a330ed91530d2`;
  tree: `d70b52caa51ef1a60ebd016345a8f85e7455df81`.
- Current task: [Issue #239 — W6-08 Cross-Platform Quick Preview Experience](https://github.com/ArdenZC/Zen-Canvas/issues/239).
- Status: **COMPLETE through PR #240**.
- Authority: existing `ZenFloatingQuickPreview` / Preview Core / Preview Host /
  Read / Materialization / WorkScheduler seams; no second Preview authority.
- W6-09 was the subsequent track after the explicit residual disposition gate; its accepted closeout is recorded below.
- W6-05 typed/folder Quick Preview disposition: **ACCEPTED DEFER**. The W6-08
  implementation and browser/integration evidence close the known
  presentation/support gap at repository level. Exact-head Windows/macOS
  native Quick Preview UI re-verification is carried into W6-09 Whole-Product
  Native Regression; a reproduced Preview defect may receive bounded native
  correction and re-verification there. Browser PASS != Native PASS.

## W6-09 execution record

- Activation baseline: `master@20781c8dc4dc8f24f0ed7d2ce860f5fd62d35ec9`; tree `2535499a23be61786543bab19c71e35ee7a1d36f`.
- Completed track: [Issue #241](https://github.com/ArdenZC/Zen-Canvas/issues/241) — **CLOSED / completed**; PR [#242](https://github.com/ArdenZC/Zen-Canvas/pull/242) — **squash-merged** to `master@164608f90b8233303fefcf9660822daea0ecb857`.
- Status: **COMPLETE / CLOSED — OWNER WINDOWS NATIVE PRODUCT ACCEPTANCE PASS; SOLID / CALM WINDOWS VISUAL ACCEPTANCE PASS; FULL SUPPORTED-PLATFORM NATIVE PASS NOT CLAIMED**.
- Accepted production functional baseline: `88fc663392371049fda2d71b85bd4815d073bfe0`; tree `5ca511f055b02bb511bc0873ffc5c2a2d26efadf`.
- Exact Windows native functional evidence covers first-entry Browse plus PDF pages 1/2/3, Markdown, image, loading/failed, Details, pinned/background selection, dark/compact and titlebar/focus states. This remains valid functional evidence.
- Visual acceptance was re-baselined after capture. Solid / Calm Demo V2 now owns material/presentation; Liquid Glass is revoked. Prior Windows captures are therefore historical for final visual parity.
- Solid / Calm authority is checksum-bound in `docs/design/w6-09/SOLID-CALM-V2-FREEZE-MANIFEST.md`.
- Production-head hosted CI 35608830144 is **SUCCESS**; evidence/docs-head CI 35611907483 is **SUCCESS**; presentation source CI [35685110417](https://github.com/ArdenZC/Zen-Canvas/actions/runs/35685110417) is **SUCCESS**.
- Production source is `8fd246476e025636d4606a44d23688865ab89cc2`; tree `475a8d0e0295abbe37b3afa115738fa3602785e7`. Owner Windows exact-head native product and Solid / Calm visual acceptance are **PASS**. Full supported-platform native PASS is **NOT CLAIMED**; Windows DPI/scaling, Forced Colors, real macOS GUI/Retina and release-path/release-binary acceptance are accepted residuals for W6-10. Final authority: [W6-09 Whole-Product Native Regression — Closeout Result](tasks/W6-09-WHOLE-PRODUCT-NATIVE-REGRESSION-CLOSEOUT-RESULT.md).
- Merge-after hosted CI [35697239225](https://github.com/ArdenZC/Zen-Canvas/actions/runs/35697239225) is **SUCCESS** on `master@164608f90b8233303fefcf9660822daea0ecb857`.
- W6-10 Release Re-entry has **no active implementation task**. W6-10B is blocked on missing valid SmartScreen/UAC evidence host. W6-10C is **DEFERRED / UNVERIFIED — OWNER SKIPPED** because no real supported Mac host is available. Full supported-platform GO cannot be claimed under the current support policy. Publication remains deferred.

## Review policy

Owner review and merge decisions use direct diff inspection, repository governance checks and applicable CI evidence. Codex Review is not merge authority.

## ZDB-03B2 source freezes

ZDB-03B1 is **COMPLETE / MERGED / OWNER REVIEW PASSED / PACKS FROZEN**. ZDB-03B2A is **COMPLETE / MERGED through PR #303 / ASSIGNMENT + HISTORY FROZEN**. ZDB-03B2B is **COMPLETE / MERGED through PR #304 / OWNER BLIND ADJUDICATION FROZEN**. History was unseen at adjudication freeze; the historical B2A blindness gate is satisfied. Frozen source identities remain immutable.

## ZDB-03B2C structural clarification

The first B2C assembly attempt stopped before artifact creation because an execution instruction incorrectly expected exactly 24 cold-start / 96 non-cold contexts. Owner reproduction from the five frozen inputs established the deterministic truth as **55 cold-start / 65 non-cold**: 12 designated novel-workspace controls, 12 purpose/lifecycle no-history controls, and 31 incidental finite-choice cold starts. There are 0 unexplained scope-mismatch cold starts and 0 missing correction references. See [ZDB-03B2C Cold-Start Structural Clarification](tasks/ZDB-03B2C-COLD-START-STRUCTURAL-CLARIFICATION.md).

No frozen Profile, Target, Assignment, History, or adjudication artifact changed. The B2C continuation required the frozen 55/65 constants. B3/B4 were not active at that historical clarification gate; the current bounded B4 disposition is recorded below.

## ZDB-03B2C frozen mechanical corpus

[Mechanical assembly result](../../research/zen-decision-bench/results/ZDB-03B2C-SIGNAL-CORPUS-ASSEMBLY-RESULT.md), issue #283: **OWNER CORPUS FREEZE PASSED — FROZEN FOR ZDB-03B3 INPUT** from exact `master@0c9a7b36510f2399176f8d79e29c0761f7f50d9c` after PR #305. All five sources remain unchanged. The 120 cases mechanically yield **55 cold-start / 65 non-cold**, taxonomy **12 novel-workspace / 12 purpose-lifecycle / 31 finite-choice filtered / 0 unexplained** and **0 missing correction references**. This is Owner-frozen structural truth and must not be tuned.

No provider or B2C resolver/Arm run, baseline prediction, effectiveness result or production change occurred. Owner accepted corpus content at `f1aa255d17f7b6f4749631096332549a5b7fd58b`; canonical SHA-256 `0a96faa752b488f9c507ee2d0ca64e439820f85697872a64a5972c2840693349`, file SHA-256 `e10cd216a0f6692511ec0049dccf37b51f306bd39625b858efcbac35ebac3c8a`, Git blob `0e483df2063acbc07ee599e3caa379f4a6f404bf`. Merge of PR #306 plus merge-after CI activated only ZDB-03B3 same-case canonical Generative baseline. The later B3 freeze/merge and B4 disposition are recorded below. >=300 comparative corpus, ZDB-04+ and PM-02 remain **NOT ACTIVE**.

## ZDB-03B3 same-case Generative baseline

Issue #283 / PR #309: **OWNER REVIEW PASSED — SAME-CASE GENERATIVE BASELINE FROZEN** from exact `master@3fd3e9afcdc9835dc7171d1f57d1c7542d79191b`. PR #307 and PR #308 repaired only the two prior syntax blockers; both blocked B3 attempts made zero provider requests. Preserved B3 work was restored with matching byte hashes. Candidate `9b98d48964cd1172dbd9cdd27590eaf2bf28b8d2` passed pre-provider exact-head CI 36696028168, local structural tests and request isolation. [B3 result and frozen evidence](../../research/zen-decision-bench/results/ZDB-03B3-SAME-CASE-GENERATIVE-BASELINE-RESULT.md) records exactly 120 attempts, 116 successes, 4 `managed_ai_missing_field` failures, zero retries; global exact 17/120 and adjusted 23/120. Frozen corpus and sources remain unchanged. Immutable evidence is frozen at `dc54001280e1bccc46fc7b64bef45ac69527dcc1`; final reviewed PR head before governance closeout was `876ec6f93d88a1a8d9a768b82acba181309c98f4`, with exact-head CI 36697609492 SUCCESS. No Preference Arms or production change occurred in B3. PR #309 is **MERGED** as `master@0fc3751de02a4acab07ff45dbd6523c8efa35a65`. Final B3 freeze-closeout HEAD `7fc3cb71d83f5475b4221f033673ca27ad1beb09` passed exact-head CI 36698609993; merge-after CI 36698919689 is **SUCCESS**. This activated only ZDB-03B4 offline Preference comparison. B3 is **COMPLETE / MERGED / OWNER REVIEW PASSED / BASELINE FROZEN**. >=300 comparative corpus, ZDB-04+ and PM-02 remain **NOT ACTIVE**.


## ZDB-03B4 offline Preference comparison

Issue #283 / [PR #310](https://github.com/ArdenZC/Zen-Canvas/pull/310): **OWNER REVIEW PASSED — OFFLINE SCREEN RESULT FROZEN / INCONCLUSIVE_LOW_DELTA**. [B4 result](../../research/zen-decision-bench/results/ZDB-03B4-PREFERENCE-SIGNAL-SCREEN-RESULT.md) records the frozen 120-case synthetic screen from exact `master@0fc3751de02a4acab07ff45dbd6523c8efa35a65`. Candidate runner `f353adc78b2a04d0312fe9d6073acb38e6eafa78` passed exact-head hosted CI [36701145415](https://github.com/ArdenZC/Zen-Canvas/actions/runs/36701145415) before evidence generation. Immutable B4 evidence commit: `c313e1c123686965996b478f0d56f579cde81e8f`.

B/C/D each execute all 120 cases offline. Frozen baseline availability is **116 / 4**; primary transition eligibility is **104 / 4**. Provider failures remain in full-coverage arm results and are excluded only from baseline-dependent transitions. Arm C has **7 Preference-caused changes, 6 beneficial, 0 harmful, 1 other, net +6**. Every hard gate passes, including **360/360 attribution**, zero cold-start regressions and zero frozen hash drift. Disposition: **INCONCLUSIVE_LOW_DELTA**, because 7 changes is below the pre-registered 10-change minimum.

Provider calls = **0**. No frozen corpus, B3 evidence, resolver/evaluator, Context validator, source pack, assignment, History or adjudication changed. No tuning occurred. The 60-case ZDB-03A fixture remains conformance-only. B3 is **COMPLETE / FROZEN**; B4 is **OWNER REVIEW PASSED / RESULT FROZEN**. Owner independently confirmed the committed conflict grouping as **0 conflicting / 4 superseded / 116 normal-no-conflict** per B/C/D arm. Because Gate A remains inconclusive under the pre-registered <10-change rule and no conflicting Preference cases were observed for Gate D, the **>=300 comparative corpus remains NOT ACTIVE pending a separate Owner activation decision; ZDB-04+ remain NOT ACTIVE; PM-02 remains NOT ACTIVE**. No superiority, production qualification or real-user benefit is established.

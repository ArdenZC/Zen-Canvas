# Zen Canvas Development Workflow

This workflow is the default engineering operating model for new work after G1. A narrower security/task contract may add stricter gates; it may not weaken these rules silently.

## Master-plan alignment gate

Before any non-trivial implementation Track starts, read
[`MASTER_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`](MASTER_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md) and verify that the proposed work belongs to the currently authorized Wave and active initiative.

The Master Development Plan is the long-horizon direction; it is not a task checklist. A taskbook/PR may narrow that direction but must not silently pull later-Wave scope forward or introduce a contradictory product/architecture model.

If implementation appears to require any of the following, stop and escalate before coding further:

- a cross-Wave feature that the current initiative does not authorize;
- a new durable authority or schema migration;
- replacement of an existing safety/read/mutation/query/watcher authority;
- a supported-platform change;
- a performance-threshold reduction used to make a feature pass;
- a broad native-integration subsystem that belongs to a later Wave.

Every Codex/agent implementation brief should include `MASTER_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` in its required read set. Existing in-flight Tracks created before this rule do not need to be restarted; their independent pre-merge review must verify alignment with the merged Master Plan.

## Code maintainability gate

Before materially expanding an existing source module, read
[`CODE_MAINTAINABILITY.md`](CODE_MAINTAINABILITY.md) and inspect the responsibilities already owned by that file/module.

Do not default to appending all new behavior to the existing feature file. A feature name is not a sufficient single responsibility.

Decomposition is required or must be explicitly reviewed when the change would cause a file/module to own multiple independent lifecycles or infrastructure concerns such as:

- request/session ownership plus cache/storage lifecycle;
- scheduler/admission plus an independent executor/queue;
- orchestration plus substantial filesystem/network/database/native-helper I/O;
- generic domain/service logic plus large platform-native implementations;
- multiple durable/state authorities;
- large in-file tests/fixtures that obscure production behavior.

Treat a global coordination lock covering filesystem I/O, `fsync`, provider/network calls, subprocess/native-helper work or other slow/external work as a design smell requiring explicit review.

File length is a signal, not a mechanical limit. Around 500–800 lines of hand-written production logic should trigger an active cohesion check; 1000+ lines normally require either decomposition or a clear review explanation; 1500+ lines must not gain another independent responsibility without a specific reviewed exception. Generated/data-heavy/cohesive code may legitimately differ.

Do not evade this rule by creating dozens of meaningless micro-files. The target is a small stable module surface with clear ownership and the smallest coherent decomposition.

For substantial new subsystems and Codex/agent taskbooks, include maintainability/module-boundary review in the Definition of Done. Independent reviewers may make decomposition merge-blocking when the current structure contributes to correctness, concurrency, lifecycle, locking or testability risk.

## Initiative lifecycle

```text
Research
→ Spec
→ Architecture Freeze
→ Wave/Track
→ PR
→ Review
→ Integration Gate
→ Closeout
```

The stages have distinct purposes:

- **Research** establishes the problem, evidence and affected current authorities.
- **Spec** fixes user outcome, scope, non-goals, acceptance and validation intent.
- **Architecture Freeze** records any authority, persistence, platform, permission or recovery decision before implementation.
- **Wave/Track** breaks an approved initiative into bounded execution units with one coherent branch per unit where needed.
- **PR** packages the intended diff, exact-head evidence, risks and unverified areas for review.
- **Review** checks behavior, authority boundaries, scope, maintainability/module ownership and evidence rather than only code style.
- **Integration Gate** verifies the applicable checks and current-truth updates at the exact head before merge.
- **Closeout** records the merge result, deferred work, local test-artifact cleanup and branch/content-equivalence cleanup.

Do not begin production implementation from an informal idea when the change moves architecture authority, schema, platform safety, user-file mutation or product ownership. Write the initiative/spec first.

## One coherent branch per initiative

Default branch naming:

- `feat/<initiative>` — product capability.
- `fix/<scope>` — bounded defect/remediation.
- `chore/<scope>` — governance, tooling or maintenance without product behavior change.
- `docs/<scope>` — documentation-only work.

Avoid permanent integration branches. If an initiative requires parallel sub-work, integrate through explicitly bounded branches/PRs and close them when their content is absorbed.

Never commit directly to `master` for non-trivial work.

## Local worktree lifecycle

### Main/common checkout role

The common/main checkout is the preferred stable repository entrypoint. Outside bounded owned work, it should normally return to `master + clean tracked state`. A temporarily non-master main checkout is not automatically a global blocker.

The blocker is using unknown or stale state as a new task baseline, destructive cleanup without ownership or preservation proof, or shared common-repository integrity failure where Git topology itself is unreliable. An unhealthy main checkout does not automatically block unrelated healthy linked-worktree activity.

### Bounded linked worktrees

A linked worktree should normally represent one coherent active task, review, integration or exact-SHA evidence purpose. Do not reuse an unrelated historical worktree merely because its directory exists. Before reuse, verify its branch, HEAD, status and purpose.

### Ownership / disposition

The task that creates a worktree normally owns its closeout. When the task or PR is merged, superseded or abandoned, give the worktree an explicit disposition: retire it, intentionally retain it for a current active or unresolved purpose with that reason recorded, or record the precise reason cleanup is blocked.

Do not create permanent enum or state vocabulary for these dispositions; use natural language. “Forgotten” or “historical” alone is not a valid long-term reason to retain a worktree.

### Safe retirement

Before worktree removal, verify relevant topology, committed-work preservation, staged/unstaged/conflicted/untracked state, and evidence ownership or disposition. A local branch ref protects only committed history. Ignored files are not automatically disposable. Unknown local content prevents destructive cleanup.

### Branch/worktree separation

Branch deletion and worktree removal are distinct. A worktree may be removable while its branch or ref is intentionally retained. A branch may be content-equivalent to the accepted merge while the worktree still contains local evidence requiring disposition. Continue using the existing squash content-equivalence rule; do not invent another merge-equivalence mechanism.

### Signals, not authorities

Treat `[gone]` upstream, detached HEAD, branch ahead count, age and worktree count as investigation signals only. None independently authorizes deletion.

### Repository repair vs cleanup

If normal Git operations fail because of a missing or corrupt object, invalid ref, common repository integrity problem or worktree metadata corruption, treat it as repository recovery. Do not solve repository corruption by deleting arbitrary refs or worktrees merely to make cleanup green. Repair trustworthy Git integrity first where possible.

If multiple refs or objects are damaged or ownership is uncertain, stop bounded cleanup and report the repository-repair scope.

### Git-aware removal / prune

Prefer `git worktree remove <path>` after preservation checks. Do not use force removal merely because cleanup is inconvenient. `git worktree prune` is maintenance after topology is understood; it is not a discovery or ownership tool. No scheduled or automatic prune belongs in CI.

### No numerical policy

Do not introduce a maximum worktree count, worktree TTL, branch TTL or age-based deletion. Age and count are signals only.

## Scope hygiene

Before changing files:

1. record current branch and `HEAD`;
2. confirm the intended base;
3. inspect existing callers and authority contracts;
4. inspect the responsibility/module boundary of files that will be materially expanded;
5. identify unrelated changes and leave them untouched;
6. stage only intended paths.

Do not use broad staging to absorb unrelated work.

## Atomic commits

Each commit should have one reviewable purpose. Prefer messages such as:

- `docs: install project current-truth layer`
- `fix(watcher): preserve reconciliation revision ownership`
- `refactor(runtime): split search lifecycle controller`

Avoid messages such as `update`, `fix stuff` or `refactor all`.

A large initiative may have multiple atomic commits; a small focused change may have one.

## Merge strategy

Default project strategy: **squash merge** for ordinary feature, fix, governance and integration PRs.

Use a merge commit only when preserving a meaningful multi-parent topology is itself useful and explicitly reviewed. Rebase merge is not the default project strategy.

After squash merge, the source branch's commits will not be ancestors of `master`. Branch closeout therefore uses content equivalence when ancestor checks are insufficient.

## Validation by risk

Run focused checks first, then the applicable repository gates. Validation is based on the claim that needs proof, not on repeating a fixed command list after every repository change.

During the editing loop, prefer focused validation. Run expensive broad applicable checks primarily on a stable candidate rather than after every small edit.

A previous successful result may remain useful for development reasoning when the inputs relevant to that claim, its required environment and any explicit freshness requirement have not changed. Re-run the validation when those conditions no longer hold, when the earlier result failed or was incomplete, or when the current integration/artifact stage explicitly requires fresh evidence.

Previous evidence must not be promoted into a new exact-head claim. A later production commit still requires the exact-head evidence required by the current project and CI contract unless that contract explicitly permits tree/content equivalence, a documentation-only successor or another documented reuse rule. Artifact/native evidence likewise remains bound to the exact source, artifact identity and environment actually exercised.

The current CI workflow and change-classification contract own hosted minimum validation routing. Local development and taskbooks may use narrower focused checks while iterating, but they must not maintain a competing repository path-routing table, waive required hosted lanes or reclassify production changes merely to reduce validation cost. If existing CI routing appears unnecessarily broad, change the owning routing contract through a separately reviewed and tested change rather than bypassing it inside a task.

A required gate that is red, missing or incomplete remains blocking until it passes or the owning contract is separately reviewed and changed. Proportional failure handling must not be used to reinterpret an existing required gate as optional.

When an expensive validation is repeated within the same task, record the reason when it is not obvious from the changed inputs. Valid reasons include a relevant source/test/gate change, a material claim-relevant environment or toolchain change, an earlier failed/incomplete run, a newly required exact-head integration claim, changed artifact identity or an explicit freshness requirement.

Failure handling should be proportional to the protected claim. Fail closed at the narrowest boundary that fully contains credible irreversible harm, authority violation, unsafe persistence or incorrect release. When continuing cannot create such harm, prefer truthful partial/reconciliation state, degradation or reporting rather than unnecessarily blocking a broader product or engineering workflow.

A permanent blocker should have an identifiable protected claim, credible harm and blocking scope. Temporary remediation gates should not silently become permanent project policy after their original condition is gone. Conversely, removing or weakening an existing required gate requires a separately reviewed change to the contract or routing authority that owns it.

General proportionality guidance never weakens a stricter accepted security, platform, filesystem, persistence, permission, recovery or domain-specific contract.

Typical production checks include:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run test:remediation
npm run test:performance:architecture
npm run build:check
npm run verify:rust
npm run verify:security
```

Use the current CI workflow contract for Windows/macOS, performance and package coverage. High-risk filesystem/platform/schema/performance work requires the matching full validation.

Docs-only work may use the docs fast path only when the diff is genuinely documentation-only. Do not classify production changes as docs-only to reduce CI cost.

Never claim a gate passed unless it ran successfully on the stated commit/environment.

### Local test artifact hygiene

Local validation must be disk-safe as well as logically correct.

- Prefer repository/worktree-local ignored directories for generated test data, especially `.tmp-tests/`, `.tmp-performance-fixtures/`, `.performance-temp/`, `.performance-cache/` and `.performance-artifacts/`.
- On Windows, if the worktree is on a non-system drive, repository-controlled tests/benchmarks must not default fixture, staging, cache or large temp output to `C:` through `%TEMP%`, `%TMP%`, `std::env::temp_dir()` or similar APIs. Configure the command/test harness to use a worktree-local ignored temp root on the worktree drive.
- Tests that create fixture trees or files must have an explicit ownership/cleanup strategy. Cleanup must be bounded and scoped only to task-owned paths.
- Do not solve cleanup by deleting unrelated developer state or shared dependency caches such as `node_modules`, Cargo registry/git caches or shared build caches.
- Before reporting a task complete, remove task-owned test/benchmark/staging artifacts and verify the intended temporary roots are clean. If a lock or local security policy prevents deletion, record the exact path and treat cleanup as unresolved rather than silently leaving garbage behind.
- CI runner-owned temp/workspace paths are allowed, but tests must remain portable and must not encode a developer-specific `C:` path.

## Exact-head evidence

Validation evidence must record the exact commit SHA. If a follow-up commit changes production code, earlier exact-head results are evidence for the earlier commit only.

A docs-only follow-up may reference the immediately preceding validated production head, but must state that distinction explicitly.

Earlier evidence may remain semantically informative during development when the claim's relevant inputs have not changed, but it does not satisfy a later production commit's required exact-head gate unless the current project/CI contract explicitly permits that form of evidence reuse.

## Pull request policy

- Prefer one PR for one coherent initiative or review fix.
- Broad initiatives start as Draft unless the scope explicitly says otherwise.
- PR descriptions state scope, authority changes, module/responsibility changes, risk, verification and known unverified areas.
- Review fixes stay on the same initiative when possible instead of creating permanent chains of integration branches.
- Never merge merely because CI is green; authority, maintainability, review and closeout gates still apply.

## Current-truth update before merge

Before final merge of an initiative, update as applicable:

- `docs/project/STATUS.md` — applicable product/runtime baseline, initiative state, validation, schema/version/release state.
- `docs/project/ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md` — authority/ownership changes.
- `docs/project/PRODUCT_MAP.md` — user/workspace ownership changes.
- `docs/project/TECH_DEBT.md` — debt opened, changed or closed.
- `docs/project/RISK_REGISTER.md` — project-level risk changed.
- `docs/project/ROADMAP.md` — sequencing/authorization changed.
- `docs/project/DECISIONS/` — accepted cross-cutting decisions.

Do not duplicate current state into a new closeout file.

A final squash-merge SHA cannot be known before merge. The initiative PR therefore records the exact head it validated; once merged, a bounded documentation-only closeout may record the actual initiative merge SHA and branch cleanup. That closeout does **not** need to predict or self-reference its own future squash-merge SHA unless the closeout itself changes production behavior or a long-lived authority. Keep product/runtime baselines, exact validation heads and governance/closeout evidence as separate facts.

## Closeout and branch cleanup

An initiative is closed only when:

1. intended changes are merged;
2. final initiative merge SHA is known;
3. required exact-head validation is recorded;
4. task-owned local test/benchmark/fixture/staging artifacts have been removed, or an exact cleanup blocker/path is explicitly recorded as unresolved;
5. the task-owned worktree is retired, intentionally retained for a current unresolved or active purpose with that reason recorded, or cleanup is blocked and the exact blocker is recorded;
6. `STATUS.md` reflects the merged initiative state;
7. deferred/unverified items are explicit;
8. source/integration branches are deleted after ancestor or content-equivalence verification, or an exact branch-preservation blocker is recorded; associated worktree cleanup is safely completed or an exact preservation/cleanup blocker is recorded.

Branch deletion and worktree removal are separate closeout decisions.

For squash-integrated branches, compare the branch diff/content against the merge result before deletion. An `ahead` count alone is not proof that work is missing.

A documentation-only closeout PR is bookkeeping for the already merged initiative. Its own merge SHA does not recursively become another required initiative baseline unless it changes product/runtime behavior or a durable governance authority beyond the closeout facts already reviewed.

## Release state

Keep these states separate:

```text
Implemented → Validated → Packaged → Released
```

A successful NSIS/DMG build is `Packaged`, not `Released`. A GitHub release/tag or other explicitly published distribution is required for `Released`.

## Architecture decision trigger

Create an ADR when a change:

- moves durable authority or persistence ownership;
- changes supported platforms;
- changes filesystem mutation/recovery strategy;
- changes cross-window permissions;
- introduces a new long-lived subsystem or queue;
- changes merge/CI/release governance materially.

ADRs are for long-lived architecture or governance decisions, not ordinary implementation details, local bug fixes, formatting or routine documentation edits.

Small local refactors that preserve these facts do not need an ADR.
